About The Duchess Map - a.k.a the "Meghan Markle Map"

The Duchess Map is an interactive map that chronicles the official royal engagements of Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, during her time as a working senior member of the British Royal Family from May 2018 - March 2020. The map details where the Duchess traveled, the organisations and dignitaries she met with, the topics she engaged with and the brands that she wore.

Meghan's appearances can be filtered by country, topic, event type or brand by using the 'View by Filter' options, or may be traversed in chronological order using the ‘View by Timeline’ feature.

The Duchess Map is a full-stack application designed and developed by Ashley Long and powered by Esri’s ArcGIS API for JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

Details of the Duchess' travels were originally compiled by Charlotte at Mad About Meghan.

"The Duchess Map" is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by the Duchess of Sussex or The British Royal Family.
